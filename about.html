          Hello, this web site is a work in progress. My name is Mike and i've
          been studying web development for 2 years. My co-worker Steve, gave me
          a challenge to create a site from the ground up with the knowledge
          that was gained from my studies. I has been a lot of fun. One of the
          improvements will be adding functionality with all pages.
