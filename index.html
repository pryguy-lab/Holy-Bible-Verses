          When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were
          listening, he entered Capernaum. There a centurion’s servant, whom his
          master valued highly, was sick and about to die. The centurion heard
          of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come
          and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly
          with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, because he loves our
          nation and has built our synagogue.” So Jesus went with them. He was
          not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him:
          “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come
          under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to
          come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I
          myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this
          one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to
          my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was
          amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, “I
          tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.” Then the
          men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant
          well.
