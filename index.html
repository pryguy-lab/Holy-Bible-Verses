          The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their
          hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. John answered them all,
          “I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will
          come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will
          baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in
          his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his
          barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
