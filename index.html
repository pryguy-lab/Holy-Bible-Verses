          Praise the Lord. I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the
          council of the upright and in the assembly. Great are the works of the
          Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them. Glorious and
          majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever. He has
          caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and
          compassionate.
