          So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we
          drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these
          things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek
          first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be
          given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for
          tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its
          own.
