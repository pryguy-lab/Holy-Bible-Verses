          “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also
          in me. 2 My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would
          I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3
          And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you
          to be with me that you also may be where I am. 4 You know the way to
          the place where I am going.” Jesus the Way to the Father 5 Thomas said
          to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know
          the way?” 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life.
          No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you really know me,
          you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have
          seen him.”
