          Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand
          in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but
          whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law
          day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
          which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not witherâ€”
          whatever they do prospers.
