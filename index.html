          <span class="firstLetter">M</span>oreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

          <span class="number">2</span> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
          
          <span class="number">3</span> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
          
          <span class="number">4</span> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
          
          <span class="number">5</span> And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
          
          <span class="number">6</span> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
          
          <span class="number">7</span> After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
          
          <span class="number">8</span> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
