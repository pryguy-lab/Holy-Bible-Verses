          In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be
          taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took
          place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to
          their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of
          Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because
          he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register
          with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a
          child.
