          One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of
          his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John
          taught his disciples.” 2 He said to them, “When you pray, say:
          “‘Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give us each day
          our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who
          sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.’"
