          For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
          whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For
          God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to
          save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
          but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they
          have not believed in the name of Godâ€™s one and only Son.
