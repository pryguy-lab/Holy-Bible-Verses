          Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not
          want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her
          quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord
          appeared to him in a dream and said, â€œJoseph son of David, do not be
          afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in
          her is from the Holy Spirit.
