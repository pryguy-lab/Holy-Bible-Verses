          One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and
          proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the
          law, together with the elders, came up to him. “Tell us by what
          authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this
          authority?” He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me:
          John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?” They discussed
          it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask,
          ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all
          the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a
          prophet.” So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” Jesus
          said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these
          things.”
