          At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of
          sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. Moreover,
          demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!”
          But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they
          knew he was the Messiah. At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary
          place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he
          was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. But he said, “I must
          proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also,
          because that is why I was sent.” And he kept on preaching in the
          synagogues of Judea.
