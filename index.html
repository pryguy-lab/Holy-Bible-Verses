          â€œBut to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to
          those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who
          mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the
          other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt
          from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what
          belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have
          them do to you.
