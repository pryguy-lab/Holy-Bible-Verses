          â€œTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat
          or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more
          than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the
          air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your
          heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
          Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
