          In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth
          was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and
          the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, “Let
          there be light,” and there was light. God saw that the light was good,
          and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light
          “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and
          there was morning—the first day.
