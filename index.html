          In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
          was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things
          were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him
          was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light
          shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
