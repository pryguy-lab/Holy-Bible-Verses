          Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the
          Spirit into the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the
          devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was
          hungry. The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this
          stone to become bread.” Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not
          live on bread alone.’
