          People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands
          on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus
          called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to
          me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as
          these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of
          God like a little child will never enter it.”
