          One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were
          sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from
          Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal
          the sick. Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to
          take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. When they could not
          find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof
          and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the
          crowd, right in front of Jesus. When Jesus saw their faith, he said,
          “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”
