          One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people
          were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. He saw at
          the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were
          washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to
          Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down
          and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he
          said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a
          catch.” Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and
          haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the
          nets.” When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish
          that their nets began to break. So they signaled their partners in the
          other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats
          so full that they began to sink.
