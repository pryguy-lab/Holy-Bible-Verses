          Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came
          near, Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord, I
          want to see,” he replied. Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your
          faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed
          Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised
          God.
