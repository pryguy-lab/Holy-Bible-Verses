          Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on
          him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and
          makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were
          many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He
          was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The
          Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white
          and clean, followed Him on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a
          sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself
          will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of
          the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and
          on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
