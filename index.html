          Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are
          bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. It would be
          better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around
          their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. So watch
          yourselves. “If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them;
          and if they repent, forgive them. Even if they sin against you seven
          times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you
          must forgive them.”
