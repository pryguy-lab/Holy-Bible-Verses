          The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point
          of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself
          down from here. For it is written: “‘He will command his angels
          concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their
          hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus
          answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
          When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an
          opportune time.
