          <span class="firstLetter">A</span>nd I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

          <span class="number">12</span> His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
          
          <span class="number">13</span> And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
          
          <span class="number">14</span> And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
          
          <span class="number">15</span> And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
          
          <span class="number">16</span> And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.
