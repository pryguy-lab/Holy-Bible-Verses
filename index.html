          Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was
          hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found
          nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear
          fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered. When the disciples saw
          this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they
          asked. Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not
          doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you
          can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it
          will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in
          prayer.”
