        <h1>Bible Verses</h1>
        <p class="paragraph" id="paragraph">
          <span class="firstLetter">A</span>nd there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:

          <span class="number">21</span> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
          
          <span class="number">22</span> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
          
          <span class="number">23</span> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
          
          <span class="number">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
          
          <span class="number">25</span> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
          
          <span class="number">26</span> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
          
          <span class="number">27</span> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
          
          <span class="number">28</span> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
          
          <span class="number">29</span> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
          
          <span class="number">30</span> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
          
          <span class="number">31</span> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
          
          <span class="number">32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
          
          <span class="number">33</span> This he said, signifying what death he should die.
          
          <span class="number">34</span> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
          
          <span class="number">35</span> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
          
          <span class="number">36</span> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
          
          <span class="number">37</span> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
          
          <span class="number">38</span> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
