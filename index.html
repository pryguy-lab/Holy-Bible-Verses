          <span class="firstLetter">A</span>nd Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

         <span class="number">13</span> And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
          
         <span class="number">14</span> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
          
         <span class="number">15</span> And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
          
         <span class="number">16</span> And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
          
         <span class="number">17</span> And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
          
         <span class="number">18</span> Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
          
         <span class="number">19</span> And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
          
         <span class="number">20</span> And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
          
         <span class="number">21</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
          
         <span class="number">22</span> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
