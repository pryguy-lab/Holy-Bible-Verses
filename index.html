          While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered
          with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground
          and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
          Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he
          said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.
