          during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came
          to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the
          country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the
          forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of
          Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
          ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every
          valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The
          crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all
          people will see God’s salvation.’”
