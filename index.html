          Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples
          and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate,
          a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and
          she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. When
          the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”
          Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and
          the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”
          The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his
          mother.
