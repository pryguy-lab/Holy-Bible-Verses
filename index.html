          Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease;
          where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is
          knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in
          part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I
          was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned
          like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind
          me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see
          face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I
          am fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But
          the greatest of these is love.
