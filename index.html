          Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also
          in me. My Fatherâ€™s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I
          have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3 And
          if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to
          be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the
          place where I am going.
