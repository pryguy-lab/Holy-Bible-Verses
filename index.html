          <span class="firstLetter">N</span>ow the birth of Jesus Christ was on
          this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they
          came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
          <span class="number">19</span> Then Joseph her husband, being a just
          man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put
          her away privily. <span class="number">20</span> But while he thought
          on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
          dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee
          Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
          Ghost.
