          I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with
          the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is
          completed. And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire
          and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the
          beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps
          given them by God and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the
          Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and
          true are your ways, King of the nations. Who will not fear you, Lord,
          and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will
          come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been
          revealed.”
