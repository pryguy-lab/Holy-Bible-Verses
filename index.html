          “No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a
          bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can
          see the light. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed,
          and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the
          open. Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be
          given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will
          be taken from them.”
