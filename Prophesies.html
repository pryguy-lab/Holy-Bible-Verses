      <p>What does the Bible say about Prophesy?</p>
      <p>
        â€œBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but
        inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.
        Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every
        healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A
        healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good
        fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown
        into the fire. ...
